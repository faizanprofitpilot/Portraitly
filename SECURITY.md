# üîí Security Documentation - Portraitly

## Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Portraitly AI headshot generator application.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Supabase Auth**: Secure authentication with Google OAuth
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic refresh
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication

### 2. Database Security
- **RLS Policies**: Users can only access their own data
- **Input Validation**: All database inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries only
- **Data Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit

### 3. API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Error Handling**: Sanitized error messages prevent information disclosure
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery prevention
- **Authentication Required**: All sensitive endpoints require authentication

### 4. File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Only image files allowed
- **File Size Limits**: Maximum 10MB per file
- **MIME Type Verification**: File extension must match MIME type
- **Secure Storage**: Files stored in private Supabase buckets
- **Signed URLs**: Time-limited access to uploaded files

### 5. Stripe Integration Security
- **Webhook Signature Verification**: All webhooks verified with Stripe signatures
- **Server-Side Processing**: All Stripe operations on server-side only
- **Customer Data Protection**: Minimal customer data storage
- **PCI Compliance**: No card data stored locally

### 6. Frontend Security
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevents XSS attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized
- **Secure Headers**: Comprehensive security headers
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All traffic encrypted in production

## üö® Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### Critical Issues Resolved
1. **Debug Endpoints Removed**: Eliminated information disclosure
2. **Database Schema Aligned**: Fixed authentication bypass risks
3. **RLS Policies Strengthened**: Proper access control implemented
4. **File Upload Validation**: Comprehensive security checks added

### High Priority Issues Resolved
1. **Rate Limiting Implemented**: Prevents abuse and DoS
2. **Input Validation Added**: Prevents injection attacks
3. **Error Messages Sanitized**: Prevents information disclosure
4. **CSRF Protection Added**: Prevents cross-site attacks

### Medium Priority Issues Resolved
1. **Security Headers Added**: Comprehensive protection
2. **Session Management Improved**: Better security controls
3. **Input Sanitization Enhanced**: Prevents XSS and injection

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
All sensitive environment variables are properly configured:
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Server-side only
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Server-side only
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Server-side only
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Server-side only

### Database Policies
```sql
-- Users can only access their own data
CREATE POLICY "users_select_own" ON users
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid()::text = auth_user_id::text);

-- Photos are user-specific
CREATE POLICY "photos_select_own" ON photos
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users u WHERE u.id = photos.user_id AND u.auth_user_id::text = auth.uid()::text)
  );
```

### API Rate Limiting
- **General APIs**: 60 requests per minute
- **File Upload**: 10 requests per minute
- **Stripe Operations**: 20 requests per minute

## üöÄ Security Best Practices

### 1. Regular Security Audits
- Monthly security reviews
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security analysis

### 2. Monitoring & Logging
- Security event logging
- Failed authentication attempts
- Suspicious activity detection

### 3. Data Protection
- Minimal data collection
- Regular data cleanup
- Encryption at rest and in transit

### 4. Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Multi-factor authentication where possible

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Security header validation
- Input validation testing
- Rate limiting verification

### Manual Testing
- Penetration testing
- Security code review
- Vulnerability assessment

## üìû Security Incident Response

### Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: security@portraitly.xyz
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response before disclosure

### Response Timeline
- **Critical Issues**: 24 hours
- **High Priority**: 72 hours
- **Medium Priority**: 1 week
- **Low Priority**: 2 weeks

## üîÑ Security Updates

### Regular Updates
- Dependencies updated monthly
- Security patches applied immediately
- Regular security training for developers

### Emergency Updates
- Critical vulnerabilities patched within 24 hours
- Security advisories published when necessary
- User notification for data-affecting issues
